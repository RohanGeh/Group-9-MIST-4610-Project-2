# Our 2 Questions

The first question we chose for this project was “Are there seasonal patterns in driver substance abuse related to crashes?” This question is important because it may highlight certain tendencies for substance abuse-related vehicle incidents during certain holiday seasons or during certain warmer or colder periods. The question has implications for social and public health as being able to identify periods of heightened risk can potentially inform decisions on targeted interventions, increased safety measures, awareness campaigns, etc. Being able for law enforcement to be aware and plan accordingly for periods of increased substance abuse-related crashes could be a way to increase their efficiency as an organization. There is also an economic impact as substance abuse-related crashes can be extremely costly in medical expenses, property damage, legal costs, etc. Targeting seasonal patterns may be a way to increasingly allocate economic resources more efficiently towards certain seasons to try to alleviate some financial burdens. The question may also highlight certain social and cultural trends such as when are the periods of time where substance abuse is heightened, drinking patterns, and differences in driving behavior from season to season in the area that data is provided for. The data set has information on the amount of crashes where substance abuse was involved and the dates for each of these incidents by a police department in Maryland. With the data we can see the amount of incidents by seasonality to answer the question.
